# LightWave 3D LScript package for Sublime Text

Syntax highlighting, auto completion, templates, snippets and comments toggling.

Usage
-----

Not much to say about the syntax highlighting, it just works. Auto completion in Sublime Text 2 is performed with ctrl+space and/or tab depending on the preferences. Currently auto completion is available for LScript GUI controls and LScript constants.

All the standard templates from LSED are included as Sublime Snippets and can be used as boiler plates for new projects. Also a code snippet for Modeler monitor progress is included, tab triggered with `mon`.
